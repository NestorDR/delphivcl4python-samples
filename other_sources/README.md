## Description

These scripts are slightly modified from their original versions, and I have used them to learn the recently released [DelphiVCL for Python library](https://github.com/Embarcadero/DelphiVCL4Python), which is freely available via [GitHub](https://github.com/Embarcadero/DelphiVCL4Python) or the [PIP Python Package Manager](https://pypi.org/project/delphivcl/)

Original source codes in:
- [Hello Delphi VCL for Python](https://github.com/Embarcadero/DelphiVCL4Python/blob/main/samples/HelloWorld/hellodelphivcl.py)
